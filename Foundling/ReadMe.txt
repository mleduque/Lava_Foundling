***Foundling: Between the Shades***
********by Lava Del Vortel*********
***********************************

v5.3

Mod for BG2 / BG2EE



==> Introduction

Foundling is the thrall of Thaxll'ssillvia, the Shadow Dragon found in the Temple Ruins. He is cold, calculating, and determined to be freed from his influence. He can never oppose his master on his own, but everything can change thanks to the influence of the Bhaalspawn.

The quest starts with the death of Foundling's master.

Foundling is a Shadow Adept who can use Shadow Weave Magic as well as some Shadow Magic. The mod introduces a new kind of magic with its own advantages and disadvantages. Even though Foundling is recognised as a mage, he can't use the Weave. In exchange he is given his own dark spells - mostly dark versions of well known spells, but there are some brand new ones too. Foundling can learn some new incantations during the game (but just a few). He has his own HLA.

The mod is both an NPC and quest mod and introduces new characters, areas, music, items, soundset etc.

Statistics:  Strength 14 | Dexterity 17 | Constitution 11 | Intelligence 17 | Wisdom 11 | Charisma 7
Class: Mage - Shadow Adept or (optional) Shadow Adept / Thief (does not level up as a Thief)
Alignment: Neutral Evil
Gender: Male

How to join Foundling: use your save game from before the Temple Ruins or start a new game. You will meet him just before you meet the Shadow Dragon (previous area).

Foundling is not romanceable, but the character will still talk to you a couple of times, so no worries.

==> Installation

Like every WeiDU mod - unzip the mod to your BG2 or BG2EE folder and run setup-foundling.exe and follow the instructions.
You may install Foundling's alternative class: Shadow Adept/Thief (does not level up as a Thief).




==> Known issues

- The spells MAY be erased, but there are no extra copies of Foundling's spells in the game so DO NOT ERASE them.
- You won't see the exact damage of many spells added by the mod, not sure why and I have no idea how to fix that yet.




==> Not issues

- There are some spells in the game you can learn. Put them in your quick slot and use (that's the way Foundling learns because he has scroll limitations). If you get experience for that, you succeed. If there's no experience and the scroll disappeared, you failed to learn the spell. 
- The character has the animation of a warrior: that's intended. That animation suits better the character. You may change that by the Shadow Keeper / EE Keeper.
